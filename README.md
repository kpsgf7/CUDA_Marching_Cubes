# CUDA Marching Cubes
A CUDA implementation of the marching cubes algorithm to reconstruct a 3D model from a CT Scan. This project was submitted as an assignment for the class "Parallel Programming for High Performance Computing" at the University of Missouri. A gif examing the reconstruction of a shattered pelvis is shown below.

The project requires some helper functions from the CUDA SDK. It was developed using CUDA 10.0 and an Nvidia GTX 1080 GPU.
